### **Project Idea: Intelligent Customer Feedback Analysis Platform**

#### **Overview:**
Create an "Intelligent Customer Feedback Analysis Platform" that allows companies to analyze and gain insights from large datasets of customer feedback (e.g., product reviews, support tickets, survey responses). The platform will help companies understand customer sentiment, identify common issues, and make data-driven decisions to improve their products or services.

#### **Key Features:**
1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - The platform will ingest large datasets of customer feedback stored in a SQL database hosted on Azure. This dataset can include product reviews, support tickets, survey responses, and more.

2. **Flexible Querying with GraphQL:**
   - Use GraphQL to allow users to query the feedback data dynamically. Users can filter feedback by product, date range, sentiment, or specific keywords. GraphQL will make it easy to retrieve exactly the data needed, including nested relationships like feedback tied to specific products or customer segments.

3. **Sentiment Analysis with LLM:**
   - Integrate OpenAI's API to perform sentiment analysis on the customer feedback. For each piece of feedback, the platform can determine whether it is positive, negative, or neutral, and even generate a summary of the feedback.

4. **Insight Generation:**
   - Use the LLM to generate insights based on the feedback data. For example, the LLM can summarize common customer complaints, suggest areas for product improvement, or highlight particularly positive customer experiences. These insights can be displayed on the dashboard.

5. **Real-time Feedback Monitoring:**
   - Implement real-time feedback monitoring, where new customer feedback is continuously ingested and analyzed. The platform can alert users to significant changes in customer sentiment or emerging issues.

6. **Custom Dashboards and Reports:**
   - The frontend, built with React/TypeScript, will provide users with customizable dashboards where they can visualize feedback data, sentiment trends, and LLM-generated insights. Users can create reports and export them for further analysis.

7. **Advanced Filtering and Search:**
   - Utilize GraphQL's filtering and sorting capabilities to allow users to perform advanced searches on the feedback dataset. For example, users can search for feedback that mentions a specific feature or filter by sentiment score.

8. **Feedback Categorization:**
   - Allow users to categorize feedback into different themes (e.g., usability, features, customer support) using GraphQL mutations. The platform can use the LLM to suggest categories automatically based on the content of the feedback.

9. **API for External Integration:**
   - Expose a GraphQL API that allows other systems to integrate with the platform. External systems can push new feedback data into the platform or query analyzed feedback for integration into other business intelligence tools.

#### **Technical Stack:**
- **Backend:**
  - **Go**: Implement the backend using the Gin framework for handling HTTP requests and gqlgen for managing GraphQL schemas and resolvers.
  - **GraphQL**: Provide a flexible and efficient API for querying and mutating customer feedback data.
  - **ORM**: Use GORM to interact with the SQL database on Azure, making it easier to handle complex queries and relationships between data entities.

- **Database:**
  - **Azure SQL Database**: Store the large datasets of customer feedback, ensuring data integrity and supporting complex queries.

- **Frontend:**
  - **React/TypeScript**: Build a responsive and interactive frontend where users can query data, view insights, and customize their dashboards.

- **LLM Integration:**
  - **OpenAI API**: Use OpenAIâ€™s API for sentiment analysis, summarization, and generating insights from customer feedback.

#### **Benefits of Using GraphQL:**
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Users can request only the specific data they need, reducing the amount of data transferred and improving performance.
- **Dynamic Querying**: The flexibility of GraphQL allows users to create complex queries that would be cumbersome with a traditional REST API.
- **Real-time Updates**: GraphQL subscriptions can be used to push real-time updates to the frontend, keeping users informed of the latest feedback and insights.

This project would not only showcase your ability to work with a full-stack setup but also highlight the advantages of using GraphQL and integrating LLM into a real-world application. The focus on analyzing large datasets and generating actionable insights would make it a valuable tool for businesses and a strong addition to your portfolio.
